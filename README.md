# ipChecker
To facilitate running a home web server behind a router, this script checks to see if external IP has changed, alerts user via email, and updates dynamic DNS rules via the domains.google API.

### Update:


### Installation:

Install requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Simply run the script with Python 3.6+ and allow less secure apps on your Google account to use. On first run, you will be asked to input your gmail email address and password which will then be encoded with base64 before being saved. You will need your Dynamic DNS autogenerated username and password as described in [the documentation.](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en-CA) For more info on how to set up Dynamic DNS and the process I went through writing this script check [this article.](https://mjfullstack.medium.com/running-a-home-web-server-without-a-static-ip-using-google-domains-python-saves-the-day-246570b26d88)

The script takes care of everything, if your IP has changed since you last ran it, it will update your Dynamic DNS rule on domains.google.com.

On **Windows** you can use Task Scheduler; on **Linux/Mac**, simply add `ipchecker.py` to your crontab (mark as executable with `chmod +x ipchecker.py`) and you can choose the frequency of the checks. My crontab entry looks like this:

`0 * * * * /home/me/ipChecker/ipchecker.py >> ~/cron.log 2>&1`


Logs to `ipchecker.log` in the same directory and stdout so that the logs also appear in the cron log. Check the logs if the script does not run as expected, or to see when the IP was last checked.

If you forget your IP or need to check it for any reason, running `ipchecker.py` at any time will log your current IP to the console.
